    "## Overview\n",
    "Tornasole is a new capability of Amazon SageMaker that allows debugging machine learning training. \n",
    "It lets you go beyond just looking at scalars like losses and accuracies during training and gives \n",
    "you full visibility into all tensors 'flowing through the graph' during training. Tornasole helps you to monitor your training in near real time using rules and would provide you alerts, once it has detected inconsistency in training flow. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using Tornasole is a two step process: Saving tensors and Analysis. Let's look at each one of them closely.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Saving tensors\n",
    "Tensors define the state of the training job at any particular instant in its lifecycle. Tornasole exposes a library which allows you to capture these tensors and save them for analysis. Tornasole is highly customizable to save the tensors you want at different frequencies. Refer [DeveloperGuide_TensorFlow](../../DeveloperGuide_TF.md) for details on how to save the tensors you want to save.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis of the tensors emitted is captured by the Tornasole concept called ***Rules***. On a very broad level, \n",
    "a rule is a python code used to detect certain conditions during training. Some of the conditions that a data scientist training a deep learning model may care about are monitoring for gradients getting too large or too small, detecting overfitting, and so on.\n",
    "Tornasole will come pre-packaged with certain rules. Users can write their own rules using the Tornasole APIs.\n",
    "You can also analyze raw tensor data outside of the Rules construct in say, a Sagemaker notebook, using Tornasole's full set of APIs. \n",
    "Please refer [Developer Guide for Rules](../../../../rules/DeveloperGuide_Rules.md) for more details about analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example guides you through installation of the required components for emitting tensors in a \n",
    "SageMaker training job and applying a rule over the tensors to monitor the live status of the job. \n"

    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "As a first step, we'll do the installation of required tools which will allow emission of tensors (saving tensors) and application of rules to analyze them. This is only for the purposes of this private beta. Once we do this, we will be ready to use Tornasole."

    "## Tornasole Rules Explained in depth\n",
    "Let us now walk through some of Tornasole's concepts which will be helpful to understand how rules are executed in SageMaker\n",
    "and how custom rules work. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Trial\n",
    "A Trial in Tornasole's context refers to a training job. \n",
    "It is identified by the path where the saved tensors for the job are stored. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Rules\n",
    "Rules are the medium by which Tornasole executes a certain piece of code regularly on different steps of the job.\n",
    "They can be used to assert certain conditions during training, and raise Cloudwatch Events based on them that you can\n",
    "use to process in any way you like. \n",
    "\n",
    "These are defined by the class `tornasole.rules.Rule`. A rule takes a `base_trial` which refers to the job whose run invokes the rule execution. \n",
    "A rule can optionally look at other jobs as well, passed using the argument `other_trials`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tornasole comes with a set of **First Party rules** (1P rules).\n",
    "You can also write your own rules looking at these 1P rules for inspiration.\n",
    "Refer [Developer Guide for Rules.md](../../DeveloperGuide_Rules.md) for more on the \n",
    "APIs you can use to write your own rules as well as descriptions for the 1P rules that we provide.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Storage\n",
    "The tensors saved by Tornasole are, by default, stored in the S3 output path of the training job, under the folder **`/tensors-<job name>`**. \n",
    "This is done to ensure that we don't end up accidentally overwriting the tensors from a training job with the others. \n",
    "Rules evaluation require separation of the tensors paths to be evaluated correctly.\n",
    "If you don't provide an S3 output path to the estimator, SageMaker creates one for you as: **`s3://sagemaker-<region>-<account_id>/`**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Tornasole Rules in SageMaker \n",
    "Here we will talk about how to use SageMaker to evaluate these rules on the training jobs. \n",

    "This parameter takes a list of python dictionaries, one for each rule you want to enable. \n",

    "### Writing a custom rule\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementing a custom rule involves implementing the Rule interface that Tornasole provides.\n",
    "Let us go through the exercise of writing a rule which checks whether gradients are very high.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Constructor\n",
    "Creating a rule involves first inheriting from the base Rule class Tornasole provides: `tornasole.rules.Rule`\n",
    "\n",
    "Every rule is required to take the argument `base_trial` which represents the Trial object for the job whose execution \n",
    "invokes this rule. In addition to this you might want to pass `other_trials` which represents\n",
    "list of Trial objects for other jobs if you want your custom rule to look at other jobs for some comparision. \n",
    "For this rule here we do not need to look at any other trials, so we set `other_trials` to None.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from tornasole.rules import Rule\n",
    "\n",
    "class CustomGradientRule(Rule):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, base_trial, threshold=10.0):\n",
    "        super().__init__(base_trial, other_trials=None)\n",
    "        self.threshold = float(threshold)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that apart from `base_trial` and `other_trials` (if required), we require all \n",
    "arguments of the rule constructor to take a string as value. You can parse them to the type\n",
    "that you want from the string. This means if you want to pass\n",
    "a list of strings, you might want to pass them as a comma separated string. This restriction is\n",
    "being enforced so as to let you create and invoke rules from json using Sagemaker's APIs.   \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Function to invoke at a given step\n",
    "When a rule is executed, it is invoked at each step. We need to now define what to do when the rule is invoked at a given step, `step`.\n",
    "In this function you can implement the core logic of what you want to do with your selection of tensors. If your custom rule \n",
    "has access to other trials, you can access tensors from other trials as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "This function should return a boolean value `True` or `False`. When `True` is returned,\n",
    "SageMaker will raise the exception `RuleEvaluationConditionMet`. This will also create a CloudWatch Event which can be used to configure your chosen action. \n",
    "\n",
    "The invoke function for `CustomGradientRule` to check whether tensors have large gradients can look like below:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    def invoke_at_step(self, step):\n",
    "        for tensor in self.base_trial.tensors_in_collection('gradients'):\n",
    "            abs_mean = tensor.reduction_value(step, 'mean', abs=True)\n",
    "            if abs_mean > self.threshold:\n",
    "                return True\n",
    "        return False\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, we can access the names of tensors in `gradients` collection by using the method `tensors_in_collection`. \n",
    "You can see the full API that Trial provides to get tensors in our [Developer Guide For Rules](../../DeveloperGuide_Rules.md).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Optional: RequiredTensors\n",
    "RequiredTensors is an optional construct that allows Tornasole to bulk-fetch all tensors that you need to \n",
    "execute the rule. This helps the rule invocation be more performant so it does not fetch tensor values from S3 one by one. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### RequiredTensors API \n",
    "This is a class whose object is provided as a member of the rule class, so you can access it as `self.req_tensors`. \n",
    "Its full API is described in our [Developer Guide For Rules](../../DeveloperGuide_Rules.md). \n",
    "In short, it has the following methods:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Add name of required tensor for a particular trial at given steps \n",
    "self.req_tensors.add(name=tname, steps=[step_num], trial=None, should_match_regex=False)\n",
    "\n",
    "# If required tensors were added inside `set_required_tensors`, during rule invocation it is\n",
    "# automatically used to fetch all tensors at once by calling `req_tensors.fetch()`\n",
    "# If required tensors were added elsewhere, or later, you can call the `req_tensors.fetch()` method \n",
    "# yourself to fetch all tensors at once.\n",
    "self.req_tensors.fetch()\n",
    "\n",
    "# This method returns the names of the required tensors for a given trial\n",
    "self.req_tensors.get_names(trial=None)\n",
    "\n",
    "# This method returns the steps for which the tensor is required to execute the rule at this step.\n",
    "self.req_tensors.get_tensor_steps(trial=None)\n",
    "\n",
    "# This method returns the list of required tensors for a given trial as `Tensor` objects\n",
    "self.req_tensors.get(trial=None)\n",
    "``` \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Declare required tensors\n",
    "To use this construct, you need to implement a method which lets Tornasole know what tensors you are interested in for invocation at a given step. \n",
    "This is the `set_required_tensors` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def set_required_tensors(self, step):\n",
    "    for tname in self.base_trial.tensors_in_collection('gradients'):\n",
    "        self.req_tensors.add(tname, steps=[step])\n",
    "```\n",
    "##### Accessing required tensors\n",
    "Since we defined required tensors in the `set_required_tensors` method, these will have been\n",
    "pre-fetched when invoking the rule at a given step. You can continue to access the tensors as before.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do not want to determine which tensors you want to process again, you can also just call\n",
    "self.req_tensors.get() to get them. In that case, the function would look as below:  \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def invoke_at_step(self, step):\n",
    "    for tensor in self.req_tensors.get():\n",
    "        abs_mean = tensor.reduction_value(step, 'mean', abs=True)\n",
    "        if abs_mean > self.threshold:\n",
    "            return True\n",
    "    return False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Executing the custom rule\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to now provide Sagemaker the S3 location of the file which defines your custom rule classes as the value for the field `SourceS3Uri`. \n",
    "\n",
    "From above, our rule constructor takes the arguments `base_trial` and `threshold`. The `base_trial` argument will automatically be passed by SageMaker Rule Executor. The other arguments need to be passed through the RuntimeConfigurations dictionary as a mapping from string to string. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the custom rule took `other_trials`, which represents list of Trial objects for other jobs that the rule is interested in, that can be passed by passing the argument `other-trials-paths` which needs to be in the form of `s3_path_other_trial_1;s3_path_other_trial_2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the custom rules can only have arguments which expect a string as the value except the two arguments specifying trials to the Rule (`base_trial` and `other_trials`). \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "rules_specification = [\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        \"RuleName\": \"CustomGradientRule\",\n",
