    "Tornasole is a new capability of Amazon SageMaker that allows debugging machine learning training. \n",
    "It lets you go beyond just looking at scalars like losses and accuracies during training and gives \n",
    "you full visibility into all tensors 'flowing through the graph' during training. Tornasole helps you to monitor your training in near real time using rules and would provide you alerts, once it has detected inconsistency in training flow. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using Tornasole is a two step process: Saving tensors and Analysis. Let's look at each one of them closely.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Saving tensors\n",
    "Tensors define the state of the training job at any particular instant in its lifecycle. Tornasole exposes a library which allows you to capture these tensors and save them for analysis. Tornasole is highly customizable to save the tesnsors you want at different frequencies. Refer [DeveloperGuide_TensorFlow](../../DeveloperGuide_TF.md) for details on how to save the tensors you want to save.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis of the tensors emitted is captured by the Tornasole concept called ***Rules***. On a very broad level, \n",
    "a rule is a python code used to detect certain conditions during training. Some of the conditions that a data scientist training a deep learning model may care about are monitoring for gradients getting too large or too small, detecting overfitting, and so on.\n",
    "Tornasole will come pre-packaged with certain rules. Users can write their own rules using the Tornasole APIs.\n",
    "You can also analyze raw tensor data outside of the Rules construct in say, a Sagemaker notebook, using Tornasole's full set of APIs. \n",
    "Please refer [DeveloperGuide_Rules](../../../../rules/DeveloperGuide_Rules.md) for more details about analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example guides you through installation of the required components for emitting tensors in a \n",
    "SageMaker training job and applying a rule over the tensors to monitor the live status of the job. \n"
