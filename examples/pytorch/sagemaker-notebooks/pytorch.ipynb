    "Tornasole is a new capability of Amazon SageMaker that allows debugging machine learning training. It lets you go beyond just looking at scalars like losses and accuracies during training and gives you full visibility into all tensors 'flowing through the graph' during training or inference.\n",

    "Using Tornasole is a two step process:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Saving tensors\n",
    "\n",
    "Tensors define the state of the training job at any particular instant in its lifecycle. Tornasole exposes a library which allows you to capture these tensors and save them for analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyses of the tensors emitted is captured by the Tornasole concept called ***Rules***. On a very broad level, Rules are a piece of analysis code that one writes to compares tensors across steps of a training job and analyze them in each step of the training job.\n",

    "The analysis of tensors saved requires the package `tornasole.rules`.\n",
    "\n",
