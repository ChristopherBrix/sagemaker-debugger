    "Tornasole is a new capability of Amazon SageMaker that allows debugging machine learning training. \n",
    "It lets you go beyond just looking at scalars like losses and accuracies during training and gives \n",
    "you full visibility into all tensors 'flowing through the graph' during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Tornasole is a two step process: Saving tensors and Analysis. Let's look at each one of them closely.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Saving tensors\n",
    "\n",
    "Tensors define the state of the training job at any particular instant in its lifecycle. Tornasole exposes a library which allows you to capture these tensors and save them for analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyses of the tensors emitted is captured by the Tornasole concept called ***Rules***. On a very broad level, \n",
    "A Rule is a python code used to detect certain conditions during training. Some of the conditions that a data scientist training a deep learning model may care about are monitoring for gradients getting too large or too small, detecting overfitting, and so on.\n",
    "Tornasole will come pre-packaged with certain rules. Users can write their own rules using the Tornasole APIs.\n",
    "You can also analyze raw tensor data outside of the Rules construct in say, a Sagemaker notebook, using Tornasole's full set of APIs. \n",
    "Please refer [DeveloperGuide_Rules.md](../../../rules/DeveloperGuide_Rules.md) for more details about analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example guides you through installation of the required components for emitting tensors in a \n",
    "SageMaker training job and applying a rule over the tensors to monitor the live status of the job."

    "### Instantiate and initialize tornasole hook\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE: In order to enable Tornasole functionality while running the script in SageMaker, the hook must be initialized with 'out_dir = /opt/ml/output/tensors'.**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    # Create SaveConfig that instructs engine to log graph tensors every 10 steps.\n",

    "\n",
    "### NOTE: The tornasole hook can only be registered to Gluon Non-hybrid models.\n",
    "\n",

    " # Apply hook to the model (e.g. instruct engine to recognize hook configuration\n",
    " # and enable mode in which engine will log graph tensors\n",
    "hook.register_hook(net)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Set the mode\n",
    "Set the mode you are running the job in. This helps you group steps by mode, \n",
    "for easier analysis. \n",
    "If you do not specify this, it saves steps under a `default` mode.\n",

    "\n",
    "We'll be training a mxnet gluon model for FashonMNIST dataset and collect the tensors. This will be done using SageMaker MXNet Container with Script Mode. In the first example, we will schedule the SageMaker job for training the model and at the same time enable the 'VanishingGradient' rule.

    "use to process in any way you like. \n",

    "\n",
    "Tornasole comes with a set of first party rules (1P rules).\n",
    "You can also write your own rules looking at these 1P rules for inspiration. \n",
    "Refer [DeveloperGuide_Rules.md](../../../rules/DeveloperGuide_Rules.md) for more.\n",
    " \n",
    "Here we will talk about how to use Sagemaker to evalute these rules on the training jobs.\n",
    "##### 1P Rule \n",
    "If you want to use a 1P rule. Specify the RuleName field with the 1P RuleName, \n",
